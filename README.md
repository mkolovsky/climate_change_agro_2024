This report examines the most effective strategies for maintaining agricultural
productivity under changing climate conditions. The objective was to analyze how factors like
irrigation access, soil health, pesticide and fertilizer use, and adaptation strategies impact crop
yields and economic outcomes. The study aimed to identify practices that enhance resilience to
temperature and precipitation variability while promoting sustainable productivity. The analysis
used regional crop yield data alongside climate and adaptation variables. Data cleaning and
visualizations, including scatter plots and bar charts, were performed using Python. Correlations
between temperature, precipitation, and crop yields were explored, along with the economic
impacts of different adaptation strategies. The methodology provided a comprehensive
understanding of the factors driving agricultural outcomes.
Key findings highlight that irrigation access is vital in regions with high precipitation
variability, where it significantly improves yields. Soil health enhances resilience but shows
limited direct correlation with productivity. Overuse of pesticides reduces effectiveness, making
it crucial to apply them only when needed, in precise amounts, and for specific pests or growth
stages. Crop rotation and drought-resistant crops emerged as the most effective strategies,
delivering high yields and economic benefits, while water management showed mixed results
due to regional challenges.
Our report recommends prioritizing irrigation infrastructure in vulnerable regions,
promoting practices to enhance soil health, and adopting efficient pesticide strategies. Tailored
combinations of crop rotation, drought-resistant crops, and optimized water management are
suggested to maximize productivity based on regional needs. These measures provide a roadmap
for adapting agriculture to climate change while ensuring economic and environmental
sustainability.
